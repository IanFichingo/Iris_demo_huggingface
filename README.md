# Iris_demo_huggingface

This is a simple end to end machine learning project. This is the famous Iris classification problem using the Iris dataset. In this project we classify 3 flower species. We use python to implement this project. In this project we fit the Random forest classification model. After fitting the model we deploy the model via hugging faces. In this project we use the following dependencies;
        * pandas
        * numpy
        * scikit-learn
        * gradio
        
We use the gradio library to build an app which is then deployed to hugging faces.
